			<p class=letra><i>Yeah, yeah, sick <br><br>
					(d. a. got that dope) <br><br><br><br>

					They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID) <br><br>
					You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat) <br><br>
					Infected with SARS and Corona <br><br>
					(Infected with SARS and Corona) <br><br>
					Like you took a bite off of that (Damn) <br><br>
					And it goes from martian to human (Yeah) <br><br>
					That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks) <br><br>
					They come at me with machine guns (Brr) <br><br>
					Like trying to fight off a gnat <br><br><br><br>

					Still stackin' my chips, hoes, higher than Shaq on his tiptoes <br><br>
					Atop the Empire State Buildin' <br><br>
					This shit is like child's play, children <br><br>
					I will not annihilate, kill them <br><br>
					I'll fuck around and pile еight million <br><br>
					Dead little juvenilеs, wait, chill <br><br>
					Then, I'll await my trial date 'til then <br><br>
					Ain't nothin' you say can ever Trump (Nah) <br><br>
					Mic, pencil get killed (Yeah) <br><br>
					If you're hypersensitive <br><br>
					I wasn't referencin' the vice president, chill (Chill) <br><br>
					I mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill <br><br>
					Violence but with skill <br><br>
					That's why I hence when I write ends up <br><br>
					with the mic and pencil gettin' killed (Yeah, hold up) <br><br>
					And I'm still ride or die for the squad (Yeah) <br><br>
					So you know which side that I'm on <br><br>
					If a battle line's ever drawn, but if I get involved <br><br>
					It'll be like K9's in a brawl <br><br>
					But not similar to Mike Vick at all <br><br>
					'Cause even if I don't have a dog in the fight <br><br>
					They ain't never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog <br><br>
					Got stripes like a tiger, so you might get mauled <br><br>
					A mic in the palms<br><br>
					Like claws, I can swing right for your jaw <br><br>
					and rip it off with one swipe of the paw <br><br>
					Bitch, you still on my dick or naw? (Naw) <br><br>
					If I suck, your wife is a straw (Straw) <br><br>
					I'm sick and I'm not gonna cover my mouth <br><br>
					next time that I cough <br><br><br><br>

					They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID) <br><br>
					You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat) <br><br>
					Infected with SARS and Corona <br><br>
					(Infected with SARS and Corona) <br><br>
					Like you took a bite off of that (Damn)<br><br>
					And it goes from martian to human (Yeah)<br><br>
					That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)<br><br>
					They come at me with machine guns (Brr)<br><br>
					Like trying to fight off a gnat (Yeah, yeah)<br><br><br><br>

					And d. a. got that dope he sends to me (Uh-huh) <br><br>
					It's like pneumonia symptoms and contracting COVID instantly <br><br>
					Which is what separates my flow from theirs <br><br>
					So that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me <br><br>
					So vocalistically (What?) , that's social distancing (Yeah) <br><br>
					Flow going viral, you best stay strapped <br><br>
					With that Lysol and get way back <br><br>
					Get that Pine-Sol and that Ajax <br><br>
					'Cause this dry cough is just <br><br>
					like football umpires callin' a playback <br><br>
					Bitch, back the fuck up like fifteen yards <br><br>
					these rhymes call for a face mask (Face mask) <br><br>
					'Nother fourteen-day quarantine <br><br>
					They're cordoning off everything <br><br>
					This shit lookin' like a horror scene <br><br>
					like me metaphorically (Damn) <br><br>
					'Cause them stay-at-home orders seem <br><br>
					like they just keep getting more extreme <br><br>
					Who knows when this nightmare will end? <br><br>
					Like Monroe, Norma Jean <br><br>
					Still got that heroin lyrical drip <br><br>
					with that morphine and that Thorazine <br><br>
					'Cause I'm so fuckin' dope (Dope) and you're a fiend <br><br>
					And that's the one thing that hasn't changed (Nope) <br><br>
					for some semblance of normalcy <br><br>
					But I might need that Hydrochloroquine <br><br>
					'cause I got that (Yeah) <br><br>
					The Dark Horse, I'm a knight-mare <br><br>
					Mom fed me Valium like air <br><br>
					Thought that's why they called it a high chair (Woah) <br><br>
					I got a contact like eyewear <br><br>
					Woah, wait a minute, bitch, let me lie here <br><br>
					20 20 hindsight in my side mirror <br><br>
					Every year, you drop the ball like Times Square <br><br>
					My hair trigger whenever I get an idea<br><br>
					Fuck, now my name rings out like a sponge mop<br><br>
					And my drip was a drop<br><br>
					In the bucket, so that gun shot<br><br>
					You just heard just now in that one spot<br><br>
					Just came from the nine mil' that I just got<br><br>
					That's big bucks and I got a full money clip and I'm loaded<br><br>
					I ain't even mean to go the fuck off<br><br>
					I'm still totally inappropriate with an opiate<br><br>
					Groping it while I'm holding it like a trophy<br><br>
					I'm hoping a little codeine'll get me OD'in'<br><br>
					Woah, everything is slow, I begin to floating<br><br>
					I know that I'm getting loaded, the pen exploded<br><br>
					Hiroshima with the flows, a utopia<br><br>
					With the dope, I'm an OG, I'm like the G. O. A. T<br><br>
					Here to get your goat little bit of sodium, it's assault<br><br>
					When I'm at the podium, at your throat, holy camoly<br><br>
					I'm in the zone with the shit I'm on<br><br>
					Get Imodium and a commode because nobody's even close<br><br>
					You're petroleum to plutonium, you're a phony<br><br>
					I'm at the crib with your ho<br><br>
					got her at the pole like voting with no clothing<br><br>
					Stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating<br><br>
					I've got my nose in the air like a Boeing<br><br>
					Then I got into a little bit of an argument with her<br><br>
					So I took a little lick of a Klonopin at dinner<br><br>
					Then I hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her<br><br>
					Then I shot her in the liver<br><br>
					delivered her to the bottom of the river<br><br>
					But I'm probably gon' jump in the water with her<br><br>
					With a wad of money 'cause I got a lot of it<br><br>
					And when it come to drippin'<br><br>
					I be soppin' like a hundred mile an hour<br><br>
					Never runnin' out of either one of 'em, I gotta get it 'cause<br><br><br><br>

					They say these bars are like COVID (Bars are like COVID)<br><br>
					You get 'em right off the bat (You get 'em right off the bat)<br><br>
					Infected with SARS and Corona<br><br>
					(Infected with SARS and Corona)<br><br>
					Like you took a bite off of that (Damn)<br><br>
					And it goes from martian to human (Yeah)<br><br>
					That's how the virus attacks (That's how the virus attacks)<br><br>
					They come at me with machine guns (Brr)<br><br>
					It's like trying to fight off a gnat (Fight off a gnat)<br><br>
